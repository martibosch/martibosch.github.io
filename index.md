I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering in the [CEAT](http://ceat.epfl.ch/) team of the [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](http://www.epfl.ch), studying the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization and their impacts on the environment and human well being, with a focus on the urban heat island effect.

Before that I was an intern in the [STEEP](https://team.inria.fr/steep/) group of the INRIA Rhone-Alpes, working on a project to measure urban sprawl through the analysis of crowd-sourced data.

I have also interned the [CERN](http://www.cern.ch) in the summer of 2015, and the [Tyrex](https://team.inria.fr/tyrex/) team of INRIA Rhone-Alpes in 2014.
