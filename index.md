I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering in the [CEAT](http://ceat.epfl.ch/) team of the [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](http://www.epfl.ch), focusing on the assessment of the impacts of urban patterns on transportation, the environment and human well being. I try to address such question from the complexity sciences, understanding urban patterns as the spatial signature of multiple interactions between urban residents, firms and governmental bodies.

Before that I was an intern in the [STEEP](https://team.inria.fr/steep/) group of the INRIA Rhone-Alpes, working on a project to measure urban sprawl through the analysis of crowd-sourced data. This internship corresponded to my Master's Thesis from the [Artificial Intelligence and the Web](http://mosig.imag.fr/ProgramEn/M2S1#AIW) specialization of the Master of Science in Informatics at Grenoble.

I have also interned the [CERN](http://www.cern.ch) in the summer of 2015, and the [Tyrex](https://team.inria.fr/tyrex/) team of INRIA Rhone-Alpes in 2014.
